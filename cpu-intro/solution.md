# The Abstraction: The Process

## Homework (Simulation)
This program, process-run.py, allows you to see how process states change as programs run and either use the CPU (e.g., perform an addin struction) or do I/O (e.g., send a request to a disk and wait for it to complete). See the README for details.

## Question

1. Run process-run.pywith the following flags: -l 5:100,5:100. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.  
    
   100 % CPU, these is no IO process.
    ```
    ./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
    1    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    2    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    3    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    4    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    5    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    6       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    7       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    8       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    9       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    10      DONE   RUN:cpu         1          

    Stats: Total Time 10
    Stats: CPU Busy 10 (100.00%)
    Stats: IO Busy  0 (0.00%)   
    ```

2. Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use -c and -p to find out if you were right.
   
   4(process 0 CPU) + 4(process 1 IO) + 1(process 1 CPU) = 9.
   ```
    $ ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -c -p
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
    1    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    2    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    3    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    4    RUN:cpu     READY         1          
    5       DONE    RUN:io         1          
    6       DONE   WAITING                   1
    7       DONE   WAITING                   1
    8       DONE   WAITING                   1
    9       DONE   WAITING                   1
    10*     DONE      DONE         1

    Stats: Total Time 10
    Stats: CPU Busy 6 (60.00%)
    Stats: IO Busy  4 (40.00%)   
   ```

3. Switch the order of the processes: -l 1:0,4:100. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use -c and -p to see if you were right)
   
   Process 1 run when Process 0 is wating for I/O completes.
   ```
    $ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
    1     RUN:io     READY         1          
    2    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    3    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    4    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    5    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    6*      DONE      DONE         1

    Stats: Total Time 6
    Stats: CPU Busy 6 (100.00%)
    Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)
   ```

4. Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH ON END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

    Proecss 1 will not run when process 0 is waiting for I/O completes.
   ```
    $ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p -S SWITCH_ON_END
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
    1     RUN:io     READY         1          
    2    WAITING     READY                   1
    3    WAITING     READY                   1
    4    WAITING     READY                   1
    5    WAITING     READY                   1
    6*      DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    7       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    8       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
    9       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          

    Stats: Total Time 9
    Stats: CPU Busy 5 (55.56%)
    Stats: IO Busy  4 (44.44%)
   ```

5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH ON IO).What happens now? Use -c and -p to confirm that you are right.
   
    Process 1 run while Process 0 is wating for I/O completes.

   ```
    $ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p -S SWITCH_ON_IO
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
    1     RUN:io     READY         1          
    2    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    3    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    4    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    5    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
    6*      DONE      DONE         1

    Stats: Total Time 6
    Stats: CPU Busy 6 (100.00%)
    Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)
   ```
   
6. One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With -I IO_RUN_LATER, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather,whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH ON IO -I IO RUN LATER -c -p) Are system resources being effectively utilized?
   
    No, Process 0 will schedule after others finished.

   ```
    $ ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -c -p -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1    PID: 2    PID: 3       CPU       IOs
    1     RUN:io     READY     READY     READY         1          
    2    WAITING   RUN:cpu     READY     READY         1         1
    3    WAITING   RUN:cpu     READY     READY         1         1
    4    WAITING   RUN:cpu     READY     READY         1         1

    6*     READY   RUN:cpu     READY     READY         1          
    7      READY      DONE   RUN:cpu     READY         1

    Stats: IO Busy  12 (44.44%)
   ```
   
7. Now run the same processes, but with -I IO RUN IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

   When Proceess 0 wating for I/O completes, Others will be run at the same time.

   ```
    $ ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -c -p -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE
    Time    PID: 0    PID: 1    PID: 2    PID: 3       CPU       IOs

8. Now runwith some randomly generated processes: -s 1 -l 3:50,3:5 or -s 2 -l 3:50,3:50 or -s 3 -l 3:50,3:50. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag -I IO RUN IMMEDIATE vs. -I IO RUN LATER?What happens when you use -S SWITCH ON IO vs. -S SWITCH ON END?
